# Drone Terraform Deploy Plugin

This project provides a [Drone](drone.io) plugin docker image that contains the [Terraform](terraform.io) binaries and a small Go app that receives the Drone meta-data and executes Terraform commands.

Documentation for Drone Plugin development can be found here: http://readme.drone.io/plugin/

See [DOCS](docs.md) for details on this plugin's configuration and usage.
